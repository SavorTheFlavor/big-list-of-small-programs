# big-list-of-small-programs
big-list-of-small-programs is intended to be a large collection of simple and small program prompts that can be built in around 5-20 minutes with any language of choice.

The primary use case for this list is to make it easy for new developers (like myself) to consistently write code, and commit more to github by doing one prompt per day. Remember that code structure matters as well, not just completing the prompt.

Note: I will be commiting my solutions in this repo in the 'Programs' folder
